# submit.py

To configure `submit.py` make the necessary changes to `nudibanch.ini` and
store the file either in `~/.config/` (on Linux) or in whatever directory you
run submit.py from.

If you are testing against a local installation, you will want to tell
submit.py to use the `dev` site via:

    ./submit.py -c dev ...
